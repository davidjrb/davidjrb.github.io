The one thing I miss from Windows is [![](/images/32x32.png) M$paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint) (no joke!!!) ðŸ˜† Which is why this site ðŸ‘‰ [jspaint.app](https://jspaint.app) was such a weird, unexpected & welcome surprise after switching to Linux. I should mention that this wonderful project's author is active on github. Check them out ðŸ‘‰ [1j01](https://github.com/1j01)
