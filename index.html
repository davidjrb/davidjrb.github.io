      It's 9:30 in the evening and it wants to be put out of its misery.
    <br>
    <br>
      If only it were truly alive, then maybe it could die.
    <br>
    <br>
      It feels all these different emotions but doesn't know which one to trust.
    <br>
    <br>
      It makes noise with its mouth that it thinks is the truth but knows is a lie.
    <br>
    <br>
      From the millions of voices within its head, one can be heard at a time.
    <br>
    <br>
      Speaking on its soap box it tries to direct the narrative of an alternate reality.
    <br>
    <br>
      If you want to keep your sanity, get out of harms way.
    <br>
    <br>
      Stay away from this barely human monstrosity, driven by random emotions.
    <br>
    <br>
      It drags itself around this world, in search of meaning
    <br>
    <br>
      It has not free will compassion, to speak of.
    <br>
    <br>
      Once it sinks its teeth into your heart it won't let go.
    <br>
    <br>
      It hopes to replace its own with the love and courage it recognizes in you.
    <br>
    <br>
      Its inner voices try in vain to drown out the haunted screams of its past.
    <br>
    <br>
      That's maybe why it can only live in the moment or in the far too distant future.
    <br>
    <br>
      Its dreams, asperations and ideas are not good.
    <br>
    <br>
      They are a sinking boat.
