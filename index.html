      If only it were alive, then maybe it could die.
    <br>
    <br>
      It feels all these different emotions but doesn't know which one to trust.
    <br>
    <br>
      It makes noise with its mouth that it thinks is the truth but knows is a lie.
    <br>
    <br>
      Of the millions of voices within, only one can be heard at a time.
    <br>
    <br>
      From the top of a soap box it acquires a dogmatic conviction of its own rambling.
    <br>
<br>
It is motivated by its own randomly self generated emotional illusions.
    <br>
    <br>
      A fictitious means to justify immediate gratification and fornication.
    <br>
    <br>
      It drags itself around this world, in search of meaning.
    <br>
    <br>
      It has no free will or compassion for others.
    <br>
    <br>
            A Cartesian demon's influence is slow but relentless.
    <br>
    <br>
     It hopes to gain your courage and mend its sick heart by consuming yours. 
  <br> <br>
 Once it sinks its teeth in it won't let go. 
    <br>
    <br>
     
      Its inner voices try in vain to drown out the haunted screams of its past.
    <br>
    <br>
      That's maybe why it can only live in the moment or in the far too distant future.
    <br>
    <br>
      Its dreams, asperations and ideas are not good.
    <br>
    <br>
      They are a sinking boat.
    <br>
    <br>
      Disembark before its too late.
