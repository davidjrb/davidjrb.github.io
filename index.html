      If only it were alive, then maybe it could die.
    <br>
    <br>
      It feels all these different emotions but doesn't know which one to trust.
    <br>
    <br>
      It makes noise with its mouth that it thinks is the truth but knows is a lie.
    <br>
    <br>
      From the millions of voices within, one can be heard at a time.
    <br>
    <br>
      From its soap box it tries to create the narrative of an alternative reality.
    <br>
    <br>
      If you want to keep your sanity then get out of harms way.
    <br>
    <br>
      Stay away from this wannabe Cartasian demon.
    <br>
    <br>
      If you pay attention you'll notice that there's no rhyme or reason to its thinking.
    <br>
    <br>
      Its driven by its own random self generated emotional illusions.
    <br>
    <br>
      A fictitious means to justify immediate gratification and fornication.
    <br>
    <br>
      It drags itself around this world, in search of meaning.
    <br>
    <br>
      It has no free will or compassion for others.
    <br>
    <br>
      Once it sinks its teeth into your heart it won't let go.
    <br>
    <br>
      It hopes to replace its own with the love and courage it recognizes in you.
    <br>
    <br>
      Its inner voices try in vain to drown out the haunted screams of its past.
    <br>
    <br>
      That's maybe why it can only live in the moment or in the far too distant future.
    <br>
    <br>
      Its dreams, asperations and ideas are not good.
    <br>
    <br>
      They are a sinking boat. 
    <br>
    <br>
      Save yourself. 
    <br>
    <br>
      Disembark before its too late.
