      <p>
        It's 9:30 in the evening and it wants to be put out of its misery.
      <br>
      <br>
        If only it were truly alive, then maybe it could die.
      <br>
      <br>
        It feels all these different emotions but doesn't know which one to trust.
      <br>
      <br>
        It makes noise with its mouth that it thinks is the truth but knows is a lie.
      <br>
      <br>
        From the millions of voices within its head, one can be heard at a time.
      <br>
      <br>
        Speaking on its soap box it tries to direct the narrative of an alternate reality.
      <br>
      <br>
        If you want to live then get out of harms way.
      <br>
      <br>
        Stay away from this emotional zombie, stumbling through life, with no free will and not an ounce of genuine compassion.
      <br>
      <br>
        It will eat your pure heart to replace its own.
      <br>
      <br>
        Its brain generates a random patch sheet pillow case to try to muffle the haunted screams of its heart's past.
      <br>
      <br>
        That's maybe why it can only live in the moment or in the far too distant future.
      <br>
      <br>
        Its dreams, asperations and ideas are not good.
      <br>
      <br>
        They are a sinking ship.
